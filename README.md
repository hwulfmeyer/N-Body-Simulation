# N-Body Simulation

### Simulation Setup:

The classical N-body problem simulates the evolution of a system of N bodies, where the force exerted on each body arises due to its interaction with all the other bodies in the system.

### The Algorithm:

The naive implementation would simply calculate each force for each object also called all-pairs-agorithm.


### Algorithm Optimization:
